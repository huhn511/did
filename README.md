# Digital Identity (DID)
This is a work-in-progress library for Digital Identity on IOTA. It follows the Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v0.13 and Verifiable Credentials standards created by the W3C Community Group. The concept of digital identity allows people, businesses, devices and anything else to identify themselves online, while remaining fully in control of this process.
